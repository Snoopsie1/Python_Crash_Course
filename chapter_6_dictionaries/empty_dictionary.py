#Sometimes it's convenient to start with a clean, empty dictionary and fill it up as the program goes.
# Like an inventory in a game perhaps?
player_inventory = {}
print(player_inventory)

player_inventory["weapon"] = "hands of gu'den"
player_inventory["armor"] = "vestments of j√∂rg"
print(player_inventory)

#Typically you'll use empty dictionaries when storing user-supplied data.
